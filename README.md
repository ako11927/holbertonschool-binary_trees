# 0x1C. C - Binary Trees

This project covers creating, traversing, and manipulating binary trees in C.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand what a binary tree is  
- Distinguish between binary trees and binary search trees  
- Know what complete, full, perfect, and balanced binary trees are  
- Learn traversal types: preorder, inorder, postorder  
- Measure depth, height, and size of a binary tree  

## Requirements
- Compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with:  
  `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`  
- Use **Betty** style  
- Max 5 functions per file, no global variables  

## Data Structure
```c
typedef struct binary_tree_s
{
    int n;
    struct binary_tree_s *parent;
    struct binary_tree_s *left;
    struct binary_tree_s *right;
} binary_tree_t;
